This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming involving mutable and immutable references. The `bug.rs` file shows code that attempts to modify a value via an immutable reference, resulting in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a corrected version illustrating proper use of mutable references.
